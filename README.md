# 🔧 Solidity Practice – Daily Progress & Smart Contracts

Welcome to my Solidity learning journal. This repository tracks my daily hands-on practice with smart contracts. Every file here reflects real progress, lessons learned, and working code — not theory.

## 📅 Daily Progress Log

### ✅ Day 1 – SimpleBank
- ✔️ Built the `SimpleBank` contract
- ✔️ Learned how to use `msg.value` and `msg.sender`
- ✔️ Understood the difference between `address.balance` and internal user balances
- ✔️ Deployed and tested via Remix
- 💡 Key Insight: internal accounting is essential when handling ETH in a contract

---

### 🔄 Day 2 – Voting (coming next)
- 🔲 Build a voting contract
- 🔲 Use `struct`, `mapping`, `modifiers`, and `events`
- 🔲 Enforce one vote per user
- 🔲 Add access control and voting deadline
- 🔲 Test contract logic thoroughly

## 📂 Smart Contracts

| Name         | Description                         | Status       |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|--------------|
| `SimpleBank` | ETH deposit & withdrawal system     | ✅ Complete  |
| `Voting`     | Simple voting with per-user logic   | 🔄 In Progress |

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far

- Solidity basics: `contract`, `mapping`, `require`, `msg.sender`, `msg.value`
- Secure ETH handling in contracts
- Testing with Remix IDE
- Best practices for logic separation and user tracking
- Difference between on-chain ETH and internal balance mappings

---

## 🛠️ Goal

Master practical Solidity by building at least 5 complete contracts, integrate with Hardhat + frontend (React or Ethers.js), and be job-ready for Web3 dev roles.
